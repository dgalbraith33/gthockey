    <p>
        The Georgia Tech Ice Hockey Club is a student-run organization. While we do have a coaching staff, they are
        primarily responsible for handling the on-ice performance of the team, supporting the student board with
        off-ice operations only when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every spring after the conclusion of the season, the team holds a meeting to elect a new group of board members.
        These players are then entrusted with preparing the team for and managing the team throughout the season.
